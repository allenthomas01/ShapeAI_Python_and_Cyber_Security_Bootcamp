# ShapeAI Python and Cyber Security Bootcamp


-This is a project done by me as part of the python and cyber security bootcamp conducted by ShapeAI 

# Working of code

- The python code fetches the weather data by using the weather api.
- You can use the api by creating an account and generating the api key from here  https://openweathermap.org/api for free.
- When the code runs you will be asked to enter a city and the api will fetch the weather details for that city.
- After the code runs the temperature , weather description , humidity , wind speed and the date & time will be returned as output.
- Then the data is stored in a text file named myfile.txt in your file manager.


# Instructions
- Make sure that you replace your own api key in  'ENTER_YOUR_API_KEY_HERE' .
